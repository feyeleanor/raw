== About ==

RAW is a high-level interface to Go's unsafe and reflection packages, built around the concept of raw byte buffers.
Being able to create a byte slice from arbitrary types enables them to be manipulated using many of the standard
IO interfaces provided by the core package library and greatly eases the sharing of memory buffers with other
language runtimes.

== Licensing ==

Currently RAW is dual-licensed.

The library can be included in your project as "Random Access Woe" under a standard BSD-style license.

"Read it And Weep" is the closed-source variant of the library. It is in all particulars identical to the open-source
version but requires a commercial usage license. Further details are available from the author on request.

In both cases RAW does what it says on the tin: namely carve a swath of destruction through Go's type safety mechanisms.
Because of the nature of the library no warranty is provided as to its suitability or fitness for purpose. MISUSE WILL
RESULT IN DAMAGE.
